In today's digital world, protecting your images is more important than ever. With the rise of online content, it's crucial to ensure your work is protected from unauthorized use. An effective way to do this is by applying watermarks to your images.

But what happens when you have hundreds, or even thousands of images that need to be protected? That's where automation comes into play.

With the following bash script, we simplify the process of applying large-scale watermarks. Let's see how it works.

The script loops through each image in the specified directory, obtaining its size and automatically calculating the proportional size of the watermark.

It then resizes the watermark to perfectly fit each image, removing any embedded color profiles to ensure a clean, consistent application.

Finally, apply the watermark to the bottom of each image, with a centered bottom margin for an elegant and professional presentation.

With this automated process, you can protect your images efficiently and reliably, keeping your work safe and secure at all times.
